# Functional Requirements Document for Malware Attack Data Visualization and Prediction Application

## Project Overview and Functional Requirements:
The project aims to develop an application based on Snowflake that utilizes Language Model (LLM) for data visualization and prediction of malware cyber attacks. The application will provide users with tools to analyze malware attack data, visualize it interactively, and predict future trends and patterns in attacks.

## Application Objectives:
The main objective of the application is to provide users with an efficient means of analyzing, visualizing, and predicting malware attacks using advanced features of Snowflake and the prediction capabilities of Language Model (LLM).

## Content:
The application will include features for data visualization, trend analysis, and malware attack prediction. It will provide detailed reports on detected patterns and future attack predictions.

## Functional Solution

### Target Audience:
The target users of the application are cybersecurity professionals, security researchers, and organizations looking to understand and anticipate malware attacks.

### Compatibility:
The application will be developed to work on web and mobile platforms. It will be accessible via standard web browsers as well as dedicated mobile applications, ensuring flexible and ubiquitous use.

### Application Features:
1. **Data Visualization:** Users will be able to explore malware attack data using interactive charts, heatmaps, and other visualization tools.
2. **Trend Analysis:** Users can analyze past trends of malware attacks and identify recurring patterns.
3. **Attack Prediction:** The application will use Language Model (LLM) to predict future malware attacks based on historical trends and current data.
4. **Customization:** Users will have the option to customize visualization settings and prediction models according to their specific needs.

### Security and Privacy:
The application will ensure data security and privacy by implementing encryption, authentication, and access control measures in compliance with industry security standards.

### Documentation and Support:
Comprehensive documentation will be provided to guide users on how to use the application, interpret data, and understand predictions. Additionally, technical support will be available to address user questions and resolve issues.

### Costs and Revenue:
The application will initially be offered to users for free. Revenue models may be explored later, such as premium subscriptions offering advanced features or customized consulting services. However, the primary focus will be on providing value to users and promoting cyber security.
